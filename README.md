# Loan Status Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 1. Background and Overview
The Loan Status Prediction project aims to predict whether a loan applicant's request will be approved or rejected based on multiple demographic, financial, and historical factors. Using machine learning, we train models to make informed decisions by analyzing a dataset from a loan institution.

The dataset used for this project consists of several applicant attributes such as income, marital status, education level, loan amount, credit history, and others. The objective is to classify loan applications into one of two categories: Loan Approved or Loan Not Approved.

## 2. Data Structure Overview

The dataset contains the following features:
| Column Name        | Description                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Loan_ID**         | Unique Loan ID                                        |
| **Gender**          | Gender of the applicant (Male/Female)                 |
| **Married**         | Marital status (Yes/No)                               |
| **Dependents**      | Number of dependents (0, 1, 2, 3+)                    |
| **Education**       | Education level (Graduate/Not Graduate)               |
| **Self_Employed**   | Whether the applicant is self-employed (Yes/No)       |
| **ApplicantIncome** | Applicant's income                                    |
| **CoapplicantIncome** | Co-applicant's income                                |
| **LoanAmount**      | Loan amount in thousands                              |
| **Loan_Amount_Term** | Term of loan in months                               |
| **Credit_History**  | Whether the applicant has a credit history (1/0)      |
| **Property_Area**   | Type of property area (Urban, Semi-urban, Rural)      |
| **Loan_Status**     | Target variable (Y = Loan Approved, N = Loan Not Approved) |

The target variable is Loan_Status, which we aim to predict based on the other features.


## 3. Executive Summary
The primary objective of this project was to develop machine learning models that could accurately predict whether a loan application would be approved or not based on applicant information. After thorough data cleaning, preprocessing, and handling missing values, several models were trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression: Baseline accuracy of 80.48%.
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Post-tuning accuracy of 80.66%.
Random Forest Classifier: Achieved the best results with hyperparameter tuning, yielding a final accuracy of 80.48%.
Despite reasonable accuracy, additional fine-tuning and enhancements could further improve the model performance, particularly for handling the imbalanced classes (loan approvals vs. rejections).


## 4. Insights Deep Dive

### üîç Key Observations:

- **üí≥ Credit History**: Having a positive credit history plays a major role in determining loan approval. Applicants with credit history (`Credit_History=1`) have a significantly higher chance of loan approval.

- **üíµ Applicant Income & Loan Amount**: High applicant income does not necessarily guarantee loan approval. Instead, the **loan-to-income ratio** (`LoanAmount / ApplicantIncome`) is a critical factor for predicting approval.

- **üèòÔ∏è Property Area**: Applicants from **urban** and **semi-urban** areas are slightly more likely to get their loans approved compared to **rural** applicants.

- **üëî Self Employment Status**: Self-employed individuals tend to have a lower approval rate, possibly indicating a perceived higher risk associated with such applicants.

- **üéì Education Level**: Graduates have a slightly higher approval rate than non-graduates, likely reflecting higher perceived financial stability.

- **üìÖ Loan Amount Term**: The loan term doesn‚Äôt significantly impact the loan status, but applicants requesting longer terms may face additional scrutiny depending on their income.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Model Performance:

- **üå≤ Random Forest Classifier**: This model performed the best after tuning, indicating the importance of model complexity and hyperparameter adjustment in improving prediction accuracy.

- **üìà Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: Both performed similarly, though SVC showed a slight improvement after tuning, demonstrating the benefits of optimization.



## 5. Recommendations

**1. Addressing Data Imbalance:**
The dataset is slightly imbalanced between approved and rejected loans. Applying techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or adjusting class weights could improve model performance, particularly for predicting loan rejections.

**2. Feature Engineering:**
Create derived features like loan-to-income ratio or debt-to-income ratio to improve predictive power. These ratios could better capture the relationship between income, loan amount, and loan term.

**3. Model Explainability:**
Utilize tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to better understand the model's predictions and the contribution of each feature. This could also help in making the model more interpretable for stakeholders.

**4. Additional Evaluation Metrics:**
Instead of relying solely on accuracy, include other metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score to ensure that the model performs well in both loan approval and rejection cases. Precision/Recall would be particularly useful in handling imbalanced datasets.

**5. Further Model Tuning:**
Experiment with more advanced models like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) or XGBoost, which often outperform traditional classifiers in structured data tasks. Additionally, deeper hyperparameter tuning could lead to even better results.
